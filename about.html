                        <p> Nine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN (stylized as NIИ), is an American industrial
                            rock band formed in 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and
                            producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until the addition of
                            English musician Atticus Ross in 2016. </p>
                        <p> Reznor recorded the band's debut album, Pretty Hate Machine (1989), while working overnight
                            as a janitor at a Cleveland recording studio. After feuding with the label TVT Records about
                            promotion, Reznor signed with Interscope Records and released the EP Broken (1992). The
                            following albums, The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999), were released to
                            critical acclaim and commercial success. </p>
                        <p> Following a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album,
                            With Teeth (2005). Following the release of Year Zero (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a
                            feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released Ghosts I–IV (2008) and
                            The Slip (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, Hesitation Marks (2013), was
                            followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs Not the Actual Events (2016) and Add Violence
                            (2017) and their ninth album Bad Witch (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails released two further
                            installments in the Ghosts series, Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts. </p>
                        <p> Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him. The band has varied over the
                            decades, and as of 2019 includes Robin Finck, Alessandro Cortini, and Ilan Rubin. Nine Inch
                            Nails concerts since 2005 often employ thematic visual elements, extensive use of special
                            effects, and elaborate light shows; songs are often rearranged for performance, and elements
                            of songs that are not scheduled to be performed in their entirety are occasionally
                            assimilated into other songs. </p>
                        <p> Nine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 Grammy
                            Awards, winning for the songs "Wish" (1992) and "Happiness in Slavery" (1996). In 1997, Time
                            named Reznor one of the most influential people, and Spin has described him as "the most
                            vital artist in music". In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on its list
                            of the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were nominated for induction into the Rock and
                            Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 (their first year of eligibility), nominated again in 2015, and
                            are scheduled for induction in May 2020. </p>
