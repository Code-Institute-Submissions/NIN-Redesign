# NIN Website Redesign

This is a redesign of the Nine Inch Nails website, with the aim to bring a new look to the site, and to showcase the band music, and provide hub for news and information about the band.

With that in mind, I have included News, and tour dates on the main page. From there are links to discography, media, about and contact pages.

## UX
